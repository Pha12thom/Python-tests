# Nesting
Nesting is where we put an `if` statement within an `if` statement using the power of indenting.
The second `if` statement within the first `if` statement must be indented and its `print` statement needs to be indented one more time. 

  
Pay attention to the vertical lines (as shown with the blue arrows in this image) to ensure your indents line up correctly.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you notice the second `if` statement below about `faveCharacter` and how it is indented?

```python
tvShow = input("What is your favorite tv show? ")
if tvShow == "peppa pig":
  print("Ugh, why?")
  faveCharacter = input("Who is your favorite character? ")
  if faveCharacter == "daddy pig":
    print("Right answer")
  else:
    print("Nah, Daddy Pig's the greatest")
elif tvShow == "paw patrol":
  print("Aww, sad times")
else:
  print("Yeah, that's cool and allâ€¦")
```

### I highly doubt your favorite TV shows are Peppa Pig and Paw Patrol. Copy the code above and change it to match your favorite TV shows and characters.
